This garden was established in late 2024 in the front of the Willows Nursery school. The planting area used to have a tree, but after the tree died, the area was left unattended. Cars started to drive over it, compacting the soil, and leading to flooding of the parking lot.

## Plants Featured (13 species)

### Wildflowers
- **California Poppy** (*Eschscholzia californica*) - The state flower of California
- **Bee Plant** (*Scrophularia californica*) - Bees are extremely attracted to the tiny maroon and yellow flowers 
- **Sticky Monkeyflower** (*Diplacus aurantiacus*) - Cheerful orange and yellow blooms from spring through summer
- **California Fuschia** (*Epilobium canum*) - Late season nectar source

### Grasses & Sedges

## Impact

In its first season, we documented visits from native bees, hummingbirds, and arboreal salamanders. Prevented flooding in the parking lot.

## Maintenance

This garden requires minimal maintenance once established—just an annual late-summer/fall pruning of spent flower stalks and occasional weeding during the first two years.
