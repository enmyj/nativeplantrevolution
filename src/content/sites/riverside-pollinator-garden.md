This garden was established on Earth Day 2024 in partnership with Portland Parks & Recreation. Located along a busy pedestrian path, it serves as both a demonstration garden and vital habitat corridor for urban pollinators.

## Plants Featured

### Wildflowers
- **Oregon Grape** (*Mahonia aquifolium*) - Early spring blooms for emerging bumblebees
- **Red Flowering Currant** (*Ribes sanguineum*) - Hummingbird favorite
- **Douglas Aster** (*Symphyotrichum subspicatum*) - Late season nectar source
- **Common Camas** (*Camassia quamash*) - Stunning blue spring display

### Grasses & Sedges
- **Blue Wild Rye** (*Elymus glaucus*) - Native bunch grass providing structure
- **Slough Sedge** (*Carex obnupta*) - Thrives in the moist riverside soil

## Impact

In its first season, we documented visits from over 15 species of native bees, multiple hummingbird sightings, and a resident family of song sparrows who nested in the currant bushes.

## Maintenance

This garden requires minimal maintenance once established—just an annual late-winter cutback of spent flower stalks and occasional weeding during the first two years.
