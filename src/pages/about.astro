		<h1>About Native Plant Revolution</h1>

		<p>
			Native Plant Revolution is a community-driven initiative dedicated to transforming 
			landscapes across neighborhoods by replacing conventional lawns and ornamental gardens 
			with beautiful, ecologically rich native plant gardens.
		</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>
				We believe that every garden, no matter how small, can make a difference. Our mission 
				is to restore native habitats one yard at a time, creating corridors of biodiversity 
				that support pollinators, birds, and countless other species that depend on native plants 
				for survival.
			</p>
			<p>
				By documenting and sharing native plant gardens in our community, we hope to inspire 
				others to join the movement and discover the joy of gardening with nature, not against it.
			</p>
